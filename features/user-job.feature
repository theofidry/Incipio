Feature: Jobs related user management
  There is a mandate for every year.
  A mandate is composed of a group of users, although may not have any user.
  The job of a user is the job he has occupied for a given mandate.
  A job must belong to a mandate.
  At each new mandate, the jobs available are the job enabled.
  A job may be left empty.
  New jobs are created for the current mandate.
  A user may have one or several mandate, with or without a job.

  Scenario: It should be possible to get the jobs of a user per mandates.
    Given I authenticate myself as "admin"
    When I send a "GET" request to "/api/users/1"
    Then the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json"
    And the response status code should be 200
    And the JSON should be equal to:

  Scenario: When adding a job to a user, the mandate concerned should be required.
    #TODO

  Scenario: If a user has the same job for several mandates, changing the job title or abbreviation for a given mandate should not affect the others.
    #TODO: beginning of steps
    # Given user `u1` has the job `jobX` for the mandates `m1` and `m2`.
    # If I renamed the title or abbreviation of `jobX` which will become `jobY`, for the mandate `m1`,
    # the modification will not apply for `m2`, i.e. it will result in `jobX` for `m1` and `jobY` for `m2`.
    # Under the hook a new job must be created and added to the user for the given mandate.

  Scenario: It should be possible to delete a job for a user.
