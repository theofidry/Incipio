# Development Environment

This branch is dedicated to the development environment of the project. All work to do on this point has to be merge on this branch first, before being merged on other branches.

The purpose of this environment is to ease the development process. We preconfigured a Virtual Machine just for you. The only thing you have to do is to install the requirements and the deployment will be done with only one command.

### Requirements

* [Vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/)
* [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/)

# Getting started

## Install

* Install the requirements
* Install the Vagrant box: `vagrant box add jessie http://static.gender-api.com/debian-8-jessie-rc2-x64-slim.box --provider virtualbox`
* Start the Vagrant VM: `vagrant up`

If the provision fails, you can try to run ad hoc Ansible commands with a greater verbosity:

```
ansible-playbook -i .vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/action_provision --private-key=~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key -u vagrant ansible/playbook.yml -vvvv
```

## Usage

* HTTP access: `localhost:8080`
* SSH access: `vagrant ssh`
* MySQL access:
    * user : `root`
    * no password
    * remote access: specify `127.0.0.1` as host (port `3307`) (requires MySQL client)
* redis access:
    * remote access allowed (requires redis client)
    * host: `127.0.0.1`
    * port: `6379`

If you wish to reload configuration: `vagrant provision`

If you need to execute a root command, you can either use `sudo` or login as root the root user with `su` (password:
`vagrant`).

If you wish to change the port used because they overlap with already used ports or whatever your reason is, check
the configuration in the `Vagrantfile`.

# Known bugs

It is possible that the update of the system and the composer install takes very long. For the later, you can drop the task and run it manually it usually takes less time and at least you have an idea of the progress. If you do so, you will have to run manually the tasks which have been configured after this command. Hopefully, it is just creating the database or updating it ;)
